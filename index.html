        <h2 class ="Title">History of Hawaii! (information from wikipedia!)</h2>
        <p id ="Start-History">The history of Hawaii describes the era of human settlements in the Hawaiian Islands. That history begins sometime between 124 and 1120 CE,[1] when the islands were first settled by Polynesians. Hawaiian civilization was isolated from the rest of the world for at least 500 years.</p>

<p id = "Middle-History">Europeans led by British explorer James Cook arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1778. Within five years, European military technology helped Kamehameha I conquer and unify the islands for the first time, establishing the Kingdom of Hawaii. The kingdom was prosperous and important for its agriculture and strategic location in the Pacific.</p>

<p id = "End-History">American immigration began almost immediately after European contact, led by Protestant missionaries. Americans set up plantations to grow sugar. Their methods of plantation farming required substantial labor. Waves of permanent immigrants came from Japan, China and the Philippines to work in the fields. The government of Japan organized and gave special protection to its people, who comprised about 25 percent of the Hawaiian population by 1896.</p>
